Assignment 1: The Mexico Dice Game
---------------------------------

For general overview and rules see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_(game)
For a run of the game see below.

Simplifications:
    - Any randomly chosen player starts.
    - If more players have the same lowest result of a round, the first
    (or randomly selected) is the looser (no replay).

Clarifications:
    - If a player rolls more than MAX_ROLLS (see example below) or the number of
    rolls of the leader an automatic switch to next player will occur.

The following steps are recommended.

1.  Inspect the given code src/Mexico (read comments!).

2.  Inspect the functional decomposition sketch, mexico.pdf.

3.  From the above, try to figure out arguments and return values
    for the methods in the lower parts of the sketch (the simplest ones)
    Implement and **test** one at the time.

    HINTS
    For grading establish: not equal dices < equal dices < mexico.
    To remove players: Create shorter array and copy all except the one to remove.

4.  Combine the lower level methods to implement method higher up in sketch.

5.  When most (all) method implemented start with the main game loop. Make
    one round work then wrap a loop round to get the full game.

6.  Clean up code. The code in getPlayers is clumsy. Add a constructor to
    the Player class and use it in method.

A few runs of the game ("r" is roll and "n" is next player)

    Run 1  (no automatic switch in this game)

    Status: Olle 2 Fia 2 Lisa 2
    Player is Lisa > r
    Lisa got 6 and 6
    Player is Lisa > n
    Player is Olle > r
    Olle got 3 and 4
    Player is Olle > n
    Player is Fia > r
    Fia got 3 and 1
    Player is Fia > n
    Round done Fia lost!
    Next to roll is Lisa

    Player is Lisa > r
    Lisa got 5 and 6
    Player is Lisa > n
    Player is Olle > r
    Olle got 1 and 1
    Player is Olle > r
    Olle got 6 and 6
    Player is Olle > n

    Round done Lisa lost!
    Next to roll is Olle
    Status: Olle 2 Fia 1 Lisa 1
    Player is Olle > r
    Olle got 4 and 1
    Player is Olle > n
    Player is Fia > r
    Fia got 1 and 4
    Player is Fia > n
    Player is Lisa > r
    Lisa got 2 and 3
    Player is Lisa > n
    Round done Lisa lost!
    Next to roll is Olle
    Lisa has no resources will leave game.
    Status: Olle 2 Fia 1
    Player is Olle >             (not finished)

    Run 2  (automatic switch of player)

    Mexico Game Started
    Status: Olle 2 Fia 2 Lisa 2
    Player is Olle > r
    Olle got 3 and 3
    Player is Olle > r
    Olle got 2 and 5
    Player is Olle > n      (Olle 2 rolls)
    Player is Fia > r
    Fia got 3 and 4
    Player is Fia > r
    Fia got 1 and 4
    Player is Fia > r      (Fia tried to do 3 rolls)
    Player is Lisa >       (Switch to next)
    etc.

    Run 3  (game ending)
